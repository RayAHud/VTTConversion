# VTTConversion
Pro-Bono VTT Conversion Project

2.10.25 Initial Commit:
VTTConversion is a Pro-Bono project for the client Culture Work (CW), a workplace culture consultant business.
CW regularly does culture assessments of their clients' workforce. Part of these assessments are
interviews which CW conducts over ZOOM meetings, using a feature which transcribes the conversations into 
VTT (Web Video Text Tracks).

My assignment and goal for VTTConversion is to develop a python script that will take these VTT files and convert
them into well formatted text documents that the client can easily read and analyze.

No actual client files are to be uploaded to this repository.
